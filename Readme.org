* .spacemacs.d
My spacemacs configuration, migrated from my [[https://github.com/yourfin/.emacs.d][.emacs.d]].

Has a couple additional layers:

** [[https://github.com/mineo/yatemplate][yatemplate]]
Integrates yatemplate and moves the templates folder to ~\~/.spacemacs.d/yatemplates~, as opposed to ~\~/.emacs.d/templates~

** [[https://github.com/ptrv/helm-smex][helm-smex]]
Integrates helm-smex and binds it to =SPC-SPC= and =M-x=. I am currently not using this

** custom-evil
Various evil customizations I have made.
